   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. This
version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version
3 of the GNU General Public License. 
&quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed
a mode of using an interface provided by the  library.
A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking
an Application with the Library.  The particular version of the
Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked
Version&quot;.
The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means
the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any
source
code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation,
are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means
the object code and/or source code for the Application, including
any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined
Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries
of the Combined Work.
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this
License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications,
a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an
Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument
passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy
of the modified version:
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort
to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever
part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions
of this License applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material
from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey
such
object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the
incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters,
data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline
functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do
both of the following:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that
the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
covered by this License.
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
license document.
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do
each of the following:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use
are
covered by this License.
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and
this license document.
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
d) Do one of the following:
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of
this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine
or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked
Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified
by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
a copy of the Library already present on the user&apos;s computer
system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary
to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work
produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified
version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation
Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and
Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must
provide the Installation Information in the manner specified
by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other
library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered
by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms
of your
choice, if you do both of the following:
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
conveyed under the terms of this License.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part
of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such
new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered
version of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later
version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the
terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as
you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of
the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it specifies
that a proxy can
decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public
License shall apply, that proxy&apos;s public statement of acceptance
of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that
version for the Library.
